<p>The MCC did not pass during the previous House session owing to the reluctance of Krishna Bahadur Mahara who was the House Speaker until early October. First of all MCC does not dictate how the grant money is used in Nepal that is totally up to our government. I think the MCC agreement with Nepal is a total trap for Nepal. Nepal Government and MCC conducted studies in Nepal to identify key problems where the MCC grant would be most valuable. However it is also the largest financial assistance agreement ever signed by Nepal.</p>

Occasionally brighter areas will form along these halos creating a mock Sun or sundog Sundogs are known as parhelia or the singular parhelion to astronomers from the Greek words meaning beside the Sun.

<p>A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its power output. A rainbow ring around the sun means that the suns rays are passing through ice crystal in cirrostratus clouds at a 22-degree angle. However for two brief periods in each of Saturns orbits about the sun the ring edge points not below or above the sun but directly at it. Also known as a 22 degree halo or a sun halo the ring is caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds within the Earths atmosphere the University of Illinois Weather World Project 2010 explains.</p>

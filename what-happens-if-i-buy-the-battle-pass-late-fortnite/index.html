<p>Its only worth it when a new pass is launched. Essentially youll have wasted 10 playing the game as a free battle pass member disqualifies the player from the XP bonuses given to owners of the battle pass. Im not going to spend any money for Fortnite but I would like to get the Batte Pass someday just using the V-Bucks that I get in the game as Ive always and now I still do got the rewards from the free battle pass not being a premium player. Even without buying the Battle Pass you can earn a total of 300 free V-Bucks from it via unlocks that are available to all players not just premium Battle Pass owners.

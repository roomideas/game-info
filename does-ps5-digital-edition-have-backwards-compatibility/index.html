<p>As part of our PS5 guide were going to explain how PS4 games will work on the PS5 and whether theyll be improved. If backwards compatibility for PS4 is confirmed then yes both will work. Most PS4 Games Will Work on PS5. However this is not the case. Playstation 5 Black Version With Cd And Ps5 Digital Edition World Today News.</p>

<p>The PS5 Digital Edition will cost at USD 39999 and the PS5 with an Ultra HD Blu ray disc drive will cost for USD 49999. The PS5 has backwards compatibility with the vast majority of PS4 games. There would be no point boasting about backwards compatibility only to make you buy your games again lol. It does mention how when using a PS4 disc it needs to be kept inserted in the PS5 for the system. The Ps5 Digital Edition Has A Big Disadvantage.</p>

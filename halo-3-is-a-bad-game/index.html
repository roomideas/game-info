<p><strong>Halo 3 Is A Bad Game</strong>, The problem is the fuck awful writing that nobody would understand unless they read up on 343s expanded universe and even after you understand whats going on its still trash. Dennis Jamison youth minister at the Meadow View church in Mesquite Texas uses Halo 3 with his youth group and doesnt believe the game is damaging to the teens who play it. Just because a game is a little aged doesnt mean we need an update especially when Microsoft is already lacking good original first party titles. But like any long-running series the Halo franchise has had its ups and downs.</p>

<p>Halo 3 ODST manages to convey a lot through Microsofts marketing efforts and extensive public display of the game thus ensuring that the franchise remains embedded in the minds of public in a positive or a negative way but as a package it feels hollow. The third installment in the Halo franchise the game concludes the story arc begun in 2001s Halo. Its repetitive and unfun. One of the biggest surprises to come to the Halo universe and the only game to change up the Halo formula in a meaningful way was Halo 3.

<p>Halo 3s only big flaw was netcodehit detection which is something Reach did indeed fix but Reach changed too much of the gameplay from previous titles with the inclusion of bloom not new to Halo but in Reach it was overkill on precision weapons loadoutsarmor abilities and other small but negatively impactful changes to gameplay. Just because a game is a little aged doesnt mean we need an update especially when Microsoft is already lacking good original first party titles. Theres no blood being splattered around like other shoot em ups. I know this might be considered cheating but it still technically says Halo 3 in the title so it counts.

<p><strong>Is Halo Infinite Gonna Be Crossplay</strong>, 343 Industries Halo Infinite console players are asking 343 Industries for a way to opt out of cross-play until an anti-cheat is implemented. I think its very safe to assume at this point that Infinite will have cross play. From what Ive heard theyre working on trying to implement it in MCC so if thats the case then theyll most likely have it in Infinite too. And unlike most fps games on PC MCC has aim assist on a controller if you dont feel comfortable with MKB.</p>

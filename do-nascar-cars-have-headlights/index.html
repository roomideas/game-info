<p>No operating headlights or taillights are. All the cars are the same the fake lights make them look like the brands they represent ie Toyota Camry Ford Fusion ect. Decals are cheaper and lighter than headlights they make the car look like a real stock car and dont shatter when bumped keeping glass off the track. The most likely reason there are no headlights is because they would be unnecessary. NASCAR cars use stickers for headlights on.</p>

<p>Phantoms they may want to prepare for the possibility Wally will return. He was the nephew and former sidekick of Barry Allen. However it is expected to premiere on HBO Max sooner rather than later. Well i still dont think he died due to speedsters always somehow being able to disintegrate into the speed force. Not only could this secret potentially drive a wedge between Artemis and her friends but it also has the potential to bring down the Team as a whole.</p>

<p>Its reasonable that Artemis and Dick have yet to move on in that time period given the length and intensity of their respective relationships with him.

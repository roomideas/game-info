<p><strong>Why Wasnt Master Chief On Reach</strong>, The game doesnt even make sense because the spartans in reach had more advanaced armor and skill than master chief yet they all died to save him instead. Its a known issue with savequitting at the intro videos in that mission not sure why it wasnt fixed all this time. Master Chief Petty Officer John 117 did fight in the Fall of Reach. When Halo first came out and not much lore was established Chief was labeled as the last S2 to make him seem more special.</p>

<p>Reach is also the home of single largest spaceship manufacturer making it the bastion of military power for human kind. Hes about as high as he can go already. Master Chief took a small squad of Spartans on what he thought was the harder mission in space and sent the rest of them down to Reach.

<p>Why isnt Master Chief ever promoted. I get it because the master chief isnt in it and this is the master chief collection but what about Halo Reach. In this situation it would make sense that the Master Chief would be frozen. And just to add even in Fall of Reach John entered cryo at the end. Actually yes if it wasnt for Cortana to distract him and stand in the way Master Chief wouldve likely died the Didacts armor and experience are the key.</p>

<p>Reach is also the home of single largest spaceship manufacturer making it the bastion of military power for human kind. This is also why a bunch of crew were jettisoned upon arriving at Installation 04 because they did not have time to revive the entire crew. What Cortana is talking about in Halo 3 is the scene in The Fall of Reach where she is selecting her Spartan for Operation. He is included in the story of Reach and being that this is essentially the prologue to Halo Combat Evolved no one should be surprised if that is indeed what the big surprise is.

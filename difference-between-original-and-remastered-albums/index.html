<p>Remastering can involve a transfer from analog to digital as well as an adjustment to the loudness dynamic range and tonal balance. The variances could be from the sourcing of the masters the packaging and even the thickness and type of vinyl used.

When a digital file is converted back to analogue during playback the original waveform is restored. Pin By Alain Robert On The Who Album Covers Time Life Music Tommy.</p>

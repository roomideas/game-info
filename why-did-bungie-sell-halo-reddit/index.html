<p><strong>Why Did Bungie Sell Halo Reddit</strong>, After seeing all the Halo-inspired weapons added to Destiny today I have come to hypothesize that there were rights issues between Bungie and Microsoft. Since Microsoft owned Halo Bungie had to give it up in order to achieve that goal. Then we have Halo 4 the first completely new title 343 made.

Then we have Halo 4 the first completely new title 343 made.</p>

<p><strong>Is Dark Souls Remastered Worth It Reddit</strong>, Assuming that Dark Souls Remastered is just updating the textures is it worth it as I already have Dark Souls on my PC and can run it with any texture mod at 60fps. Its probably most people played them in order. - Jump on L3 - More convenient Covenant management - Online features less restrictive - Native setting for HUD scaling minimum setting for me and defaults to 60fps - Particle and lighting effects look better but nearly all other graphical changes are worse or pointless. If you pirate it you loose the online part that is not too active these days but you can find somene to coop or PvP and its a cool part of the game.</p>

<p>Desperate to see him one last time she turns to Zatanna for help communicating with Wallys spirit. However now I dont know if that will be the case.

<p>Wally Wests death was very similar to Barry Allens in the original Crisis on Infinite Earth comic event and the poster puts a giant orange ball of energy behind Nightwing. The show runners said before that the speed-force was unknown to the characters in Young Justice. However he learned alongside the other sidekicks that full membership into the League was not on the table. This causes Artemis to breakdown and eventually reunite with the man who was taken from her at the end of Season 2. I have been hoping like everyone else for quite some time that Wally will return in a similar fashion to Barry Allen when he was trapped in the Speed Force.</p>

<p>The characters have mentioned Wally and made various references but aside appear to have moved on from his passing. Wally is dead he was vaporized he has been moved to some other plane of existence or in the speed force of any other thing like that because that would cheapen the impact of the death. The first Kid Flash famous sacrificed himself to save the world in Young Justice s season 2 finale and the short sequence seemed to briefly tease his return from the dead which many fans have predicted. Wally most likely didnt replicate the accident perfectly. Wally Is Back By Kayin1020 Wally West Young Justice Young Justice Young Justice League.</p>

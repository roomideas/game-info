<p><strong>Is Halo A Bad Game</strong>, The gameplay is described as great combat is the best its been in years and audio is sublime while the outlet also says it far.

<p>I dont know about you guys but I think 343 are just bad game developers and wont ever make a decent Halo game. To say any Halo game is the worst might come across a little harsh as there arent any bad ones but Halo. As a standalone game its the worst Halo so far. As Halo Infinite is free to play its likely easy for cheaters to create another Microsoft Account and keep evading bans. Pin By Blazingblade On Halo Universe Halo Concept Art Art.</p>

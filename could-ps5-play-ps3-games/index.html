Stream hundreds of PS4 PS3 and PS2 titles from a wide range of genres to your PS5 PS4 or Windows PC. There is one way to play PS3 games on PS5 and thats through PS Now.

<p>If you got your PS4 digital game through the PS3 game to PS4 digital game upgrade programme and therefore need the PS3 disc to play it you will not be able to play that PS4 digital game on your PS5 console. If homebrew developers can create an emulation architecture without source code surely Sony can do the same. This left out the PSP and PS Vita which would have been understandable given their format. The blanket response is the PS5 just isnt compatible with PlayStation 3 games. Can You Play Ps1 Ps2 Ps3 Games On Ps5 Playstation Universe.</p>

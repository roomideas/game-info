<p>In Revelation 1916 Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords Starting in the 4th century a principal way of expressing his kingship in images was to picture him seated on a throne and flanked by saints often Peter and Paul as in this sarcophagus fragment and in the catacombs painting at right. The presence of priests on his left and soldiers on his right indicates his position as leader of both Church and State while his halo gives him the same aspect as Christ in the dome of the apse. One mosaic depicts the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I clad in purple and wearing a golden halo flanked by Archbishop Maximianus various court officials and guards. The Western Roman Empire had ceased to exist. To Justinians right appear members of the imperial administration identified by the purple.</p>

<p>The Steam player needs to start the game from the Steam client and not from a desktop icon and a box with 3 options shows up. Although the soccar experience has been delisted from. That means that PC players and PS4 players can connect. Both platforms will support crossplay which will be enabled on our Official Servers between Steam and Epic Games and Unofficial Servers can choose to opt-into enabling crossplay or not.

<p>Im wondering if its worth buying the game on epic games and if the coop with my friends will work on there or should we just buy it on steam since it has. Then from the dropdown select crossplay_branch and close the properties window. Luckily for Civilization 6 players there is crossplay available between copies purchased from Steam and those purchased or gotten for free from the Epic Games Store. Never played with friends before or even added someone as friend into the game.

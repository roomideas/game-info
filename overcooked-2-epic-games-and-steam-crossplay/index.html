<p>Is there a way i can play with them all. Just bought this game did not play neither overcooked 1 nor 2 and I am having lots of fun but I think it would be way better to play with people. Steam and Windows Store cross play. Console users on PS4 Xbox and Switch are not able to play Overcooked 2 cross-platform with friends. Does Overcooked All You Can Eat Have Crossplay Gamepur.</p>

<p>Until recently the family-friendly title was not crossplay enabled on any platform but it received an update when. However on Steam if you right click the game select Properties and select Betas you can update to the current version which will allow Steam and Epic crossplay. 2 in your Steam library and select Properties In the properties window click Betas. 2 on Steam to allow EGS and Steam chefs to play together.

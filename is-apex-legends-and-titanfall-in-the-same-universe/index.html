<p><strong>Is Apex Legends And Titanfall In The Same Universe</strong>, Relation of Apex Legends and Titanfall is deep but since the release of Apex Legends we only saw a glimpse of the relation between the two games. Titanfall and Apex Legends are definitely in the same universe. The setting of Titanfall has much more narrative potential than the planned shared universe for Battlefield and already includes Apex Legends. Basically I believe apex legends is just a marketing strategy a really popular and good marketing strategy but I wanna know what everyone else thinks about this.</p>

<p>Still Apex Legends is filled with references and links to its. What Apex Legends doesnt feature is the giant Titans that the Titanfall series is known for.

Moving forward Battlefield games are going to be developed as part of a shared universe but another Electronic Arts IP - Titanfall - has a much more fascinating setting for such an endeavor. Hey mate if you just bought Titanfall 2 the campaign is amazing I recommend beating that then you can get accustom to the movement of the game go online and have some fun and yes they take place in the same universe witch if your remember the old dude and Apex and all of that at the beginning all of it will make sense now.</p>

Relation of Apex Legends and Titanfall is Beneficial for the Franchise. Despite officially being part of the Titanfall universe the incredibly popular Apex Legends doesnt rely too heavily on its ties to the mech-filled franchise.

<p>Apex Legends and Titanfall live in the same universe as the two games share lore weapons and more. From what I can remember Apex Legends takes place on an unregulated planet. I believe the only reason respawn made apex is so they can introduce people into the titanfall universe so titanfall 3 wont have the same fate as titanfall 2. The game is doing fine on consoles but the PC version reportedly has a bunch of issues including rampant DDOSing of servers and hackers in the game.

<p>If you havent played Titanfall much it might be easy to miss but the two actually share the same in-game universe. Respawn Entertainment the developers of all three games did not forget where they came from. I believe the only reason respawn made apex is so they can introduce people into the titanfall universe so titanfall 3 wont have the same fate as titanfall 2. 12 comments 66 Upvoted.

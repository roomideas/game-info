<p>Why did Bungie stop making Halo. They were so successful with the Halo series that they believed they could create another game that was different but similar in regards to the success they had. The finished Halo project ended up on the Xbox because Bungie had royally screwed the pooch with a botched release of their previous game Myth II. Bungie was originally developing Halo without Microsoft.</p>

<p>The reason why Trials is hemmoraging is very simple to the majority of the playerbase like comp the gamemode is not fun dangling rewards above players heads to play something they dont like just pisses them off and causes toxicity. Bungie was originally developing Halo without Microsoft. In all honesty I dont even think the Destiny series is great. The finished Halo project ended up on the Xbox because Bungie had royally screwed the pooch with a botched release of their previous game Myth II. Bungie is gone they stopped working on Halo because they longer have an interest in it anymore among other reasonsTheyve moved onto Destiny they have a ten year plan in place and are already developing the next Destiny game.</p>

<p>Did some of the writersgame designers stay for Halo 4 and 5. Because Bungie didnt want to keep making Halogames.

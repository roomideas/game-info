<p><strong>Is Halo 5 Multiplayer Good Reddit</strong>, In my opinion this is a good addition. Although technically the games were great they missed the it factor I grew up with. Halo 5 is literally the best multiplayer game I have ever played but I cant get my friends to play it. The forge and custom games in my opinion have never been better.</p>

<p>If i had to rank them all this would be my ranking multiplayer wise. Custom browser forge warzone ranked arena and social playlists. Fuck destiny if i wanted that id just go play it. Halo 5 had a good balance for the hardcore being developed in hand with pros but was awful at appealing to casuals with its garbage attempt at massive multiplayer matches aka Warzone leaving whats its really memorably for 8v8 to die.</p>

<p>I have told them of all the stuff that they have added since launch but nothing. Thinking of getting it but theres not really any mention of the player base currently apart from steam charts. How is the multiplayer in Halo 5. Personally I really enjoy Halo 5s multiplayer and its honestly a good evolution of the Halo game play.

<p>Halo 5 is literally the best multiplayer game I have ever played but I cant get my friends to play it.

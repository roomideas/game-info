<p>When asked if shell show up in Halo 5 Cortana will occasionally say Did you see how Halo 4 ended. Losing Cortana would have been a serious blow but its equally possible that Guardian was downed by Infinity before the Banished hit her or the Banished as they invaded the ring. This fully rampant Cortana builds a new faction called the Created which is essentially just an army of AIs who are attempting to turn the tables on the humans who made them. It completely went over my head that as the player and Master Chief basically killed Cortana by firing the nuke that killed her when it tore the Mantle apart.</p>

<p>It completely went over my head that as the player and Master Chief basically killed Cortana by firing the nuke that killed her when it tore the Mantle apart. However when she was uploaded into the Didacts ship she uploaded her personality to the Domain which supposedly cured her rampancy. When Halo 5 ended players were left with a cliffhanger leaving a potentially infected Cortana in charge. Halo 5 concludes with a cured Cortana taking control. Cortana is dead and gone.</p>
